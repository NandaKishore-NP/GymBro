# Exercise GIFs Directory

This directory contains GIF animations demonstrating proper exercise form for the workout library.

## Naming Convention

GIFs should be named using kebab-case that matches the exercise name, for example:
- `bench-press.gif`
- `barbell-squats.gif`
- `pull-ups.gif`

## Adding New GIFs

1. Use high-quality GIFs that clearly demonstrate proper form
2. Keep file sizes reasonable (ideally under 2MB per GIF)
3. Ensure the GIF shows the complete range of motion
4. Use animations that have proper form to avoid injury risk
5. Consider using Creative Commons licensed content or creating your own GIFs

## Copyright Notice

When adding GIFs to this directory, ensure you have the right to use them:
- Use royalty-free content
- Create your own GIFs
- Get proper licenses for commercial content
- Use content labeled for reuse with proper attribution

## Placeholder GIF

Until you add specific exercise GIFs, a placeholder GIF named `placeholder.gif` will be used. You can create a simple placeholder that indicates the animation is coming soon.
