# GymBro Deployment Summary

To deploy GymBro for free on Vercel with PlanetScale, here's what we've already done or need to do:

## 1. Fixed TypeScript Errors

- Added proper interfaces for database results in `app/api/profile/route.ts`
- Disabled the ESLint rule for unescaped entities in `.eslintrc.json`

## 2. Database Configuration

- Added MySQL driver (`mysql2`) to `package.json`
- Created MySQL database connection utility in `lib/mysql-db.ts`
- Modified `lib/db.ts` to work in both development and production environments
- Added production environment variables in `.env.production`

## 3. Deployment Steps

1. Create a PlanetScale account and database
2. Run the SQL scripts from `DEPLOY.md` to create your tables
3. Get your database connection string from PlanetScale
4. Deploy to Vercel with the required environment variables
5. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` after initial deployment

## 4. Remaining Tasks

For a complete deployment, you still need to:

1. **Update ALL API Routes**: Every API route must be updated to use MySQL in production, similar to how we modified the profile route.

2. **Data Migration**: You need to export your SQLite data and import it into PlanetScale.

3. **Test in Production**: Thoroughly test all features after deployment.

## 5. Considerations

- PlanetScale free tier has a 5GB storage limit
- Vercel free tier has function execution limits
- Both services have fair usage policies

See `DEPLOY.md` for detailed deployment instructions.
